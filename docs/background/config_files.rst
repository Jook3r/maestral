Config files
============

The config files are located at ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/maestral`` on Linux (typically
``~/.config/maestral``) and ``~/Library/Application Support/maestral`` on macOS. Each
configuration will get its own INI file with the settings documented below.

Config values in the sections ``main`` and ``account`` should not be edited manually but
rather through the corresponding CLI commands or GUI options. This is because changes of
these settings require Maestral to perform accompanying actions, e.g., download items
which have been removed from the excluded list or move the local Dropbox directory.
Those will not be performed if the user edits the options manually.

Changes to the other sections may be performed manually but will only take effect once
Maestral is restarted. Maestral will overwrite the entire config file if any change is
made to one of the options through the ``maestral.config`` module.
