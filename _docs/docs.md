Welcome to the user documentation. The following pages provide support for installing
and configuring Maestral, they discuss non-trivial functionality such as ".mignore"
files and sync issues arrising from unsupported file names, symlinks and other edge
cases. A full reference of the [command line interface]({{site.baseurl }}/cli) is also
available.

If you are interested in contributing to the development, please refer to the GitHub page
and the developer documentation at [Read the Docs](https://maestral.readthedocs.io). Small
financial contributions via GitHub Sponsors are also welcome to offset the cost of an
Apple Developer Program membership and basic development infrastructure.
